# 🛡️ EXE Protection Layer - Distribution Guide

## ✅ **CORRECT WAY TO SHARE YOUR PROTECTED APPLICATION**

### **What to Share with Friends/Users:**
1. **`dist/win-unpacked/EXE Protection Layer.exe`** (157MB) - This is the PROTECTED version
2. **`dist/EXE Protection Layer Setup 1.0.0.exe`** (79MB) - This is the installer version

### **What NOT to Share:**
❌ **`protected.exe`** (34MB) - This is UNPROTECTED! Anyone can run it!
❌ Individual source files (`main.js`, `index.html`, etc.)
❌ `node_modules` folder
❌ `.license_registry.dat` file (this gets created automatically)

---

## 🔍 **How It Works:**

### **Protected Version** (`EXE Protection Layer.exe`):
- ✅ Contains license validation system
- ✅ Requires valid license key to run
- ✅ Binds to specific hardware
- ✅ Cannot be copied between computers
- ✅ Shows license input dialog before launching

### **Unprotected Version** (`protected.exe`):
- ❌ No license validation
- ❌ Anyone can run it directly
- ❌ No hardware binding
- ❌ This is your ORIGINAL exe that you wanted to protect

---

## 🚀 **Distribution Process:**

1. **Build the protected version:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Share ONLY the protected executable:**
   - Give friends: `dist/win-unpacked/EXE Protection Layer.exe`
   - OR give them: `dist/EXE Protection Layer Setup 1.0.0.exe` (installer)

3. **When they run it:**
   - They'll see a license input dialog
   - They must enter a valid license key
   - The license gets bound to their hardware
   - Only then will your original `protected.exe` launch

---

## 🎯 **Result:**
- ✅ Your friends need unique license keys
- ✅ Each license works on only one computer
- ✅ No one can bypass the protection
- ✅ Your original exe is safely wrapped

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notes:**
- The protected executable is larger (157MB vs 34MB) because it includes the entire Electron framework
- Users will see a license dialog before your original application launches
- Each user needs their own unique license key
- License keys cannot be shared between different computers
